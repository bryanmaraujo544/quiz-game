> Quiz game where users can play with anothers one in real-time.

## 💻 How it works

The application has different quiz rooms and the users can play a game in real-time with others and see who was the winner.

## 💻 How it was made

For building all the interface of the app I've used the React library. To make all the business rules of the app, I made an API using Node.js with Express.js, Prisma and Socket.io.

To make all the game in real-time I've used Socket.io, that it is a WebSocket based library, which enables the exchange of data between server and client really fast.
